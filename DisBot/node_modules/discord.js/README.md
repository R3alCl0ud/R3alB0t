`npm install --save discord.js`

### Example: ping-pong
```js
var Discord = require("discord.js");

var mybot = new Discord.Client();

mybot.on("message", function(message){
	if(message.content === "ping")
		mybot.reply(message, "pong");
});

mybot.login("email", "password");
```

### Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Just clone the repo and edit the files in the **src folder, not the lib folder.** 

Whenever you come to making a pull request, make sure it's to the *indev* branch and that you have built the lib files by running `grunt --dev`
